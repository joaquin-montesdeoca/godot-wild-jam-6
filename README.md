# Cacti Vs Dinosaurs (Godot Wild Jam #6)
This game was made for **Godot Wild Jam #6** where the theme was **Out of Place Cacti**.

The idea was to make a mix between *Plants Vs. Zombies* and the Google Chrome dinosaur game.

In **Cacti Vs. Dinosaurs**, you plant cacti to prevent dinosaurs from getting to the end of the screen.

This was made in Godot 3.1.
